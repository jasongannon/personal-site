## Another Year, Another Site

I've left a trail of dead websites scattered across the internet these last 20 years or so. Good thing these is no law against it.

Eventually new tools and ideas occupy my time and I leave those old sites to gather dust (and lose hosting when I don't renew with GoDaddy or whoever).

So, to keep that trend alive, I recently canned my old personal site (a two-year old site built with HTML and w3.css). Next task was to pick my toolchain for the new site.

## First Some Background

Most of my front end development experience is old-school HTML/CSS/JS. I've experimented a fair bit over the years with tools like Sass, Bootstrap, Materialize CSS.

Anyway, cut to chase, decision was made quickly to go with an SSG. I really enjoy working with SSGs. SSGs work well for general purpose and documentation sites. I like the speed, the flexibility, the reliability. And last, but not least, I like working in Markdown.

So, which SSG? It was time to evaluate.
