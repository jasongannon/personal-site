Hello there, I'm Jason Gannon, a software developer and technical writer with 14 years of experience in development. The last few years I've focused on building great developer documentation, including developer portals and API references.

I like working closely with managers and developers to create great software products and to provide first-rate documentation and developer experiences.

Plain text, version control, and automation all make the technical writer's life easier (and less error prone), so I prefer the [Docs as Code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/) approach. I like style guides and adherence to them so the end-users have a consistent experience.

I don't need much runway on new projectsâ€” I can immediately start helping teams review designs and requirements and provide comprehensive documentation to back the product up. 

Throughout my career, I have worked with outstanding clients like EY, PwC, Nokia, Siemens, Ericsson, Hewlett Packard. I'm a team player who enjoys working with cross-functional teams to build great products.

A technical writer is a generalist who must develop a broad understanding of software development. I work hard to build trust with developers and SMEs by providing strong first drafts that minimize the time SMEs need to spend reviewing and redlining my documentation.

I have experience in a variety of programming languages and technologies, such as:

- APIs
  - RESTful design and best practices
  - OpenAPI specification
  - Style Guides, linting, client-side validation
  - Security, Authentication (Basic Auth, API KEY, OAuth)
  - Swagger, Postman, Redocly
- SSGs
  - Gatsby
  - Hugo
  - Next.js
  - Docusaurus
- Modeling/Diagramming
  - Visio/Lucid/Draw.io
  - [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/)
  - [C4 model](https://c4model.com/)
  - [Python diagrams](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/) (Diagrams as Code)
  - [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/)
- Languages/formats/frameworks
  - HTML, CSS
  - JSON, XML
  - Markdown, Pandoc, LaTeX
  - JavaScript
  - React.js
  - Python
  - .NET (C#)
  - SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
  - noSQL (MongoDB)
  - git
  - bash, zsh
  - linux, windows, macOS

I place a high importance on studying topics important to my career. I am regularly studying tool and topics that are important to my career. (One of the great advantages of my job is that I enjoy it very much!)

And I love film and music and travel. (But, hey, who doesn't?)

Please contact me if you wish to discuss ideas, opportunities, or just to chat about the ever-exciting worlds of technical writing and software development!
