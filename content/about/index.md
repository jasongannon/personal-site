## This Site's Reason for Being

The (more or less) sole reason for this site's reason for being is to provide some insight into my work and skills.

These "work and skills" regard mostly topics in software development and technical writing, especially as it regards the creation of modern, top-shelf developer documentation.

I avoid saying things like this site is to "help build my personal brand", because I can only assume a personal brand must come with things like a personal logo and personal color palette. Do I have to start selling merch? Well, I'm not prepared for all that.

Let's just say this site is a friendly tour of "what I do" for those interested to learn more.

## About Myself

Hello, I'm Jason, the author and developer of this site. I graduated from Purdue University in 2004 with a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature. I'm a technical writer and developer with 14 years of experience in software development.

Nowadays I'm focused on building great developer experiences: developer portals, API references. I also like to support developers with cross-functional responsibilities like UAT tests and the creation of design documentation, such as UML class diagrams.

I love to help managers and developers create great products and documentation. I know SMEs are busy, and I work to provide thorough research and detailed drafts to minimize the time SMEs need to spend on document review and redlines.

## How I Like to Work

Plain text, version control, and automation all make the technical writer's life easier (and less error prone), so I prefer the [Docs as Code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/) approach. I like style guides and adherence to them so the end-users have a consistent experience.

I don't need much runway on new projectsâ€” I can immediately start to help the team review designs and provide accurate, comprehensive documentation. 

## Some of What I Know

I enjoy study and I love software and hardware, so I'm happy to deep-dive into a new tool or topic needed for work.

Lately I've studied FastAPI, React, and MongoDB (the FARM stack). I love to prototype; so tools and frameworks that enable rapid development and iteration are always on my radar.

And I love film, books, music, coffee, travel, history, philosophy. (But, hey, who doesn't?)

I hope you enjoy my site. Please contact me if there are any ideas or opportunities you would like to discuss. Thanks!
