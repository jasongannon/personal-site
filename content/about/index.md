## This Site's Reason for Being

This site's reason for being (more or less) is to provide some insight into my work and skills, specifically topics relevant to software development and technical writing.

I avoid saying things like this site is to "help build my personal brand", because I can only assume a personal brand must come with things like a personal logo and personal color palette. Maybe I'd have to sell Jason Gannon-themed merchandise? Well, I'm not prepared for all that.

Let's instead call this site a friendly (if relatively lengthy) answer to the question "So what do you do?" for those interested to learn more.

## About Myself

Hi there. So, I am Jason Gannon. Well... I'm a Jason Gannon. A Google search shows there are several of us out there. To narrow it down, I am the one who graduated from Purdue University in 2004 with a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature and a minor in Economics. I'm like 99.99% sure I'm the only Jason Gannon like that. See how well I filter data?

Now that that's cleared up, I'll add that I'm also a technical writer and developer with 14 years of experience in software development, and like most people in the business that long, I've work on a lot of different projects and with a lot of different toolchains.

### What I'm Good At

My expertise is in technical writing â€” that is my first and best skill and the one I've been honing since university. I'm well versed in the tools and methodologies needed to build great documentation. So topics like style and usage, technical editing, working with SMEs, and information architecture are right in my wheelhouse.

I am a decent to very good front-end developer, especially if I get into a flow with a tool. It's the nature of the job, I tend to switch up toolchains often, which makes the day-in-day-out use of any specific tool rare and makes me very disinclined to compare my skills with those talented individuals who have true expertise with a tool like React. That all said, I can hold my own, and I can operate in a writer/developer role (I usually do).

### How I Like to Work

I'm a huge proponent of the [Docs as Code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/) approach. Plain text, version control, and automation all make the technical writer's life easier (and less error prone). I love to write in Markdown. I prefer to work in a text editor and a terminal ([VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) is my jam). I like to commit my updates, submit a merge request, then move on to the next task.

I don't need much runway on new projects (depending on complexity of course). Give me a few days to cram like a college kid during finals weeks, and I'll be prepared to support the team with accurate, comprehensive documentation.

### What I'm Up to Lately

Nowadays I focus on the methods and tools that help build great developer documentation: developer portals, API references, internal team sites. So I'm often trying out a new documentation tool or researching other developer portals to see what the best-in-class sites are offering to developers.

I enjoy study and I love software and hardware, so I'm happy to deep-dive into a new tool or topic needed for work.

Lately I've studied FastAPI, React, and MongoDB (the FARM stack). I love to prototype; so tools and frameworks that enable rapid development and iteration are always on my radar.

And I love film, books, music, coffee, travel, history, philosophy. (But, hey, who doesn't?)
