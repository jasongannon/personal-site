[{"content":"Another Year, Another Site Like many, I\u0026rsquo;ve left a trail of dead websites scattered across the internet these last 20 years or so. Good thing there are no laws against it.\nEventually new tools and ideas occupy my time and I leave those old sites to gather dust (and lose hosting when I don\u0026rsquo;t renew with domain.com or whoever).\nSo, to keep that trend alive, I recently canned my old personal site (a two-year old site built with HTML and w3.css â€” it was pretty lame, tbh).\nNext task was to pick my tools for a replacement personal site (the one you\u0026rsquo;re currently reading).\nFirst Some Background Most of my front end development experience is old-school HTML/CSS/JS. I\u0026rsquo;ve experimented a fair bit over the years with tools like Sass, Bootstrap, Materialize CSS.\nAnyway, cut to chase, decision was made quickly to go with an SSG.\nSSGs really are like printing presses for the web. I love them and they\u0026rsquo;ve really renewed my enjoyment of front-end development.\nSSGs work so well for general purpose and documentation sites. I like the speed, the flexibility, the reliability. And last, but not least, I like working in Markdown.\nWhich SSG? I had a few requirements.\nMarkdown-friendly Good for documentation sites Fun to work with No needless power (and complexity) Good support/community The list narrowed down quickly.\nNext.js is a great tool, but overpowered for my needs.\nI have good experience w/ Gatsby, so it\u0026rsquo;s always an option. But it\u0026rsquo;s old and slow and kind of a dependency nightmare in my experience.\nI like Docusaurus a lot (but probably not for personal site).\nI\u0026rsquo;ve heard very good things about Astro. I will be checking this tool out in the near future, but I needed something I\u0026rsquo;m more familiar with.\nHugo is popular for good reason. I think highly of it. Fun and fast. Markdown-friendly Modular; very DRY friendly.\nDrumroll Please So, the list narrowed down pretty quickly to Gatsby and Hugo and I went with:\nHugo, built with Go (or Golang), is slick, fast, and fun to use.\nThere is a learning curve, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re used to looking at fullstack JS. But it is elegant, clean, modular. Markdown-friendly. Did I mention it was fast?\nAnd why should Javascript have all the fun?\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/articles/new-site/","summary":"Another Year, Another Site Like many, I\u0026rsquo;ve left a trail of dead websites scattered across the internet these last 20 years or so.
